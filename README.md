# cloud-saas-online-auctioning-system

This repo includes the files Ive used to develop a cloud based online auctioning system.


The work was coded up in Python and utilises:
- Django
- Django REST API

A simple testing application (jupyter notebook is included) to test the application. 

This included report summarises the work done to develop an online auctioning app with access provided to
registered users only.

The overall solution architecture is given in Figure 1. It includes two separate microservices – one for
handling “Authorization and Authentication” and the other for the “Online Auctioning RESTful APIs”.

Communication is handled via well-defined RESTful API endpoints created for each service.
